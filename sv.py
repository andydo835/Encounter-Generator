        "Dupe" is short for "duplication", and is in reference to a Pokemon (or evolutionary related Pokemon) that you already have CAPTURED before.

        if it is a duplicate then you can ignore it and encounter a different Pokemon,

        Dupes Clause is a common optional rule that states:
            - A Pokemon (or its evolutionary-related Pokemon) that you have already captured before are "dupes" or duplicates
            - If encountering a dupe, the dupe can be ignored and you can attempt another encounter
            - This continues until finding a non-dupe
        
        Dupes Clause is used to:
